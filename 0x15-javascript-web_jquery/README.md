# 0x15. Javascript - Web JQuery

## Description

Javascript is used for many things. At Holberton School, you will use Javascript for 2 reasons:<br>
    Scripting (same as we did with Python)<br>
    Web front-end<br>
For the moment, and for learning all basic concepts of this language, we will do some scripting.
